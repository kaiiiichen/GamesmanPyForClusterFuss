Clusterfuss, by Mark Steere (July 2023).  https://marksteeregames.com

Two players, Red and Blue, on an N x N board initially filled with checkers in
a checkerboard pattern.  Red moves first.

MOVES        Every move is an orthogonal king capture: you move one of your own
             checkers one square up/down/left/right onto an occupied square,
             removing the checker that was there.  The captured checker may be
             friendly or enemy.  A move therefore always removes exactly one
             checker from the board (plus any enemy-only groups detached by it).

GROUPS       A group is a set of checkers (of either colour) connected
             orthogonally.  Diagonal adjacency is irrelevant.

RESTRICTION  A move is legal only if, afterwards, exactly one group contains
             checkers of the mover's colour.

REMOVAL      Any group detached by the move that contains only enemy checkers is
             immediately removed from the board, ending the turn.  Combined with
             the restriction above, exactly one group is left on the board at the
             end of every turn.

PASSING      Passing is not allowed, but a player with no legal move has their
             turn skipped.  The skip is modelled as a move, written '-'.

OBJECT       Remove all enemy checkers from the board.


STRING FORMATS
    Position (Readable)  side to move, then the board in row-major order from
                         the top-left square:  'x' Red, 'o' Blue, '-' empty.
                         e.g. 4x4 start -> 'xxoxooxoxxoxooxox'
    Move                 source square + direction, e.g. 'c4w'.  Squares are
                         named chess-style: file letter a.. left to right, rank
                         number 1.. bottom to top.  Directions are wasd
                         (w north, a west, s south, d east).  A skip is '-'.
